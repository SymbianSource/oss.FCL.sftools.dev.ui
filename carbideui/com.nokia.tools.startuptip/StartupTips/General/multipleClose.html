		<h3>How can I close the themes in a faster way?</h3> 
			If multiple themes are open in the tool, the editor will show only one theme at any point in time. There is a <b>Close ( x )</b> mark which appears on the right corner of the title bar of the non-active theme. Clicking on this <b>Close ( x )</b> mark will close the theme without activating it and will consume less time. You can close all the non-active themes in a single operation: Right click on the title bar of Active theme( the one which is displayed in the editor ) and choose <b>Close Others</b>.
