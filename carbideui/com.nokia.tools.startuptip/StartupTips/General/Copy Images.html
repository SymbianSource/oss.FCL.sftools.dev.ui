		<h3>How can I copy the images from file system and paste into elements?</h3> 
		Carbide.ui allows multiple ways of using images from file system. You may right-click any element and from the context 
menu, select <i>select file</i>. Alternatively, you may also just do a Ctrl+C on your local file system and do a Ctrl+V on your 
element (or select paste context menu for the element). You may also copy and paste elements from within the tool.
