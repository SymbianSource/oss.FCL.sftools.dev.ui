		<h3>How can I use the referenced colors?</h3> 
		
		If you want to: 
		<ul>
	<li>
	create themes with specific colors and </li>
	<li>if would like to change the color at one place and see how rest of theme is impacted</li>
</ul>
<i>Referenced Colors</i> is the mechanism for you. 

Use referenced colors (Use Window -> Show view -> Referenced Colors if you do not already see it below gallery) to add a 

new color group. Use this color group to define colors.
