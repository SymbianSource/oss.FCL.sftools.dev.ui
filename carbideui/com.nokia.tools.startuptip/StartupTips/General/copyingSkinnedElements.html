		<h3>How can I copy only the skinned elements from Components view in a single click?</h3> 
		Select a particular group/sub-group in the Resources view. All the elements belonging to it will be shown in the Components view.
		Now, right click on that particular group/sub-group in the Resources view. Choose Copy Elements -> Skinned only.
		<b>Skinned only</b> will appear only if one / more elements in the Components view for the particular group/sub-group have been skinned.
