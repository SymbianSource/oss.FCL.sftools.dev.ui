   66: conditioned upon your continued adherance to the following restrictions: 
   67: 
   68: (i) You may not sublicense or distribute the TCK to any third party
   69: except for any specific TCK code files identified as redistributables in
   70: the TCK User's Guide ("Redistributables"), but only: (a) as part of a

   79: 
   80: (iii) You may not disassemble or decompile binary portions of the TCK's
   81: test suites or test tools or otherwise attempt to derive the source code
   82: from such binary portions;
   83: 
   84: (iv) You may not develop other test suites intended to validate 
   85: compatibility with the Specification to which the TCK licensed hereunder
   86: corresponds;
   87: 
   88: (v) You may not use the TCK to test a third party's product;
   89: 
   90: (vi) You may not make Commercial Use of code which implements any
   91: portion of the Specification unless such code is included in a
   92: Compatible Implementation;  
   93: 
   94: (vii) You may disclose Test Reports (where "Test Reports" means those 
   95: reports generated by the TCK which identify only configuration
   96: information and the status of individual or aggregate test executions)
   97: for an implementation which You are attempting to certify in accordance
   98: with the terms of this JDL for the sole purpose of making Your
   99: implementation a Compatible Implementation, but you may not make any
  100: claims of comparative compatibility nor disclose any other TCK testing
  101: information to any party.  For example, You cannot claim that Your
  102: implementation is "nearly compatible" or "98% compatible." When You
  103: share Test Reports in any public forum, including mailing lists,
  104: marketing material or press releases, and Your implementation is not a
  105: Compatible Implementation, You must state that Your implementation is
  106: "not compatible;" and
  107: 
  108: (viii) You will protect the TCK as confidential information of Sun and, 
  109: except as expressly authorized herein, You may not disclose the TCK to
  110: any third party. This obligation of confidentiality with respect to the
  111: TCK will survive any termination or expiration of this JDL.
  112: 
  113: 2.3 Term and  Termination. This JDL shall have an initial term of 
  114: three (3) years after your acceptance of this JDL and shall thereafter
  115: automatically renew for additional one year terms unless either party
  116: provides notice to the other party sixty (60) days prior to an
  117: anniversary date. The license grants  of this JDL, are expressly
  118: conditioned upon Your not acting outside their scope, and Your continued 
  119: compliance with the material provisions of this JDL. All license grants
  120: under this JDL will automatically and immediately be revoked without
  121: notice if You fail to so comply. Upon termination or expiration of this
  122: JDL, You must discontinue all use and distribution of the Technology and 
  123: any Compatible Implementation licensed under this JDL. All sublicenses
  124: You have properly granted hereunder shall survive termination or
  125: expiration of Your rights under the JDL. Provisions which should, by
  126: their nature, remain in effect after termination or expiration shall
  127: survive, including, without limitation, the provisions of Article II
  128: (General Terms) and the TCK confidentiality obligations under this JDL.
  129: 
  130: 2.4 General License Restrictions.  Some portions of the Technology are

  142: 
  143: 3.0 Compatibility and Use of the TCK.
  144: 
  145: 3.1 Compatible Implementation TCK Requirements.  Your use of the RI and/or
  146: Modifications as part of an implementation of the Specification is a
  147: "Compatible Implementation" if the implementation meets the following
  148: requirements: 
  149: 
  150: 3.1.1 A Compatible Implementation must comply with the full Specification,
  151: including all its required interfaces and functionality; 
  152: 
  153: 3.1.2 A Compatible Implementation must either: (i) pass the most current
  154: compatibility requirements (as defined by the TCK User's Guide) which
  155: were made available by Sun one hundred twenty (120) days before first
  156: commercial shipment ("FCS") of each version of the Compatible
  157: Implementation (eg. if Your FCS was December 31, 2003, You must have
  158: passed the most current version of the TCK as of September 2, 2003); or
  159: (ii) at Your option, pass all the compatibility requirements of a newer
  160: version of the TCK and its associated TCK User's Guide;  
  161: 
  162: 3.1.3 A Compatible Implementation may not modify the functional behavior
  163: of the "Java Classes" which means the specific class libraries associated
  164: with the Technology; and 
  165: 
  166: 3.1.4 A Compatible Implementation may not modify, subset, superset or
  167: otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space, nor include any public or
  168: protected packages, classes, Java interfaces, fields or methods within
  169: the Licensor Name Space other than those required and/or authorized by
  170: the Specification. "Licensor Name Space" means the public class or
  171: interface declarations whose names begin with "java", "javax", "com.sun"
  172: or their equivalents in any subsequent naming convention adopted by Sun
  173: through the Java Community Process, or any recognized successors or
  174: replacements thereof.
  175: 
  176: 3.2 Self-Certification for Compatibility. You shall self-certify that
  177: Your Compatible Implementation passes the applicable TCK as set forth
  178: above, if and when Your Compatible Implementation in fact does so,
  179: provided that: 
  180:  
  181: 3.2.1 If Sun policy (as communicated to You by Sun) also requires
  182: verification of compatibility for Your Compatible Implementation then
  183: You shall, prior to the FCS of the Compatible Implementation, submit
  184: verification of compatibility to Sun or to an independent test facility
  185: designated by Sun. If such verification is by an independent test
  186: facility, then the reasonable costs of such activity (including any
  187: applicable fees) shall be at Your expense. Sun may publish or otherwise
  188: disclose Your test results. 
  189:  
  190: 3.2.2 Upon thirty (30) days written notice by Sun, and no more than 
  191: two (2) times per calendar year, You shall permit Sun or its authorized
  192: representative to inspect and test any Compatible Implementation which
  193: has been self-certified per this subsection 3.2 to ensure that such
  194: Compatible Implementation meets the compatibility and other requirements 
  195: for a Compatible Implementation as set forth herein. The reasonable
  196: costs of such inspection shall be at Sun's expense; provided, however,
  197: that You shall reimburse Sun for such costs if the inspection reveals
  198: that the Compatible Implementation does not meet such requirements and
  199: these deficiencies are not cured within thirty (30) days.
  200: 
  201: 4.0 Fees and Royalties.  There are no fees or royalites associated with
  202: the license grants for the Technology licensed under this JDL.
