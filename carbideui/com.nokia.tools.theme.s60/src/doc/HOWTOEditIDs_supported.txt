Here are hints how the IDs_supported.xml shall be edited

NOTE: The xml should not be edited directly but through the accompanying xls.

To edit it:
1) Open IDs_supported.xls
2) Make changes.
3) Choose "Save as" with option "Save as type" set to XML data.

In this way the xml will be generated properly in sync with xls.
(The xls contains inside XML mapping where xls columns are mapped to the xml tags.)
