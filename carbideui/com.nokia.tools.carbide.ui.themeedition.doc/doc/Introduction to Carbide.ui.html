<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p>Carbide.ui Theme Edition is a tool for creating, editing,
and packaging themes for S60 / Symbian devices. Themes enable the
creation of a custom UI by altering the look and feel or sound of
customizable UI components. Theme components are display or
sound items that can be customized to build a graphical UI or emit sounds
initiated by certain actions or events on the device.</p>
<p>Carbide.ui provides all the tools needed to define a theme; however,
it does not include tools to create the graphics or sounds used to
customize components. To create graphics and sounds, third-party bitmap editors,
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) editors, and audio editors are required.
Carbide.ui can be configured to use these applications for editing graphics or
audio content. </p>

Themes can be used to radically alter the look and feel of S60 / Symbian
devices&rsquo; UI</p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span>Changing a device's
theme only affects the look and feel of the UI. The functions
and features of the phone are not changed. <br>

This help is divided into three parts. The first provides comprehensive
information on installing and configuring Carbide.ui along with a
description of the features of Carbide.ui. The section part provides
insight into the best practices for approaching themes development. The
final part is a comprehensive reference of the components in S60 / Symbian themes.<br>
