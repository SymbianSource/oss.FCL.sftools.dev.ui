<h2>Wait/progress bar Indicators</h2>
<br>
You can add animated wait and progress bar indicators. The indicators
consist of:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Frame
graphics</span><br>
The frame graphics are displayed masked on top of the bar graphics. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Progress
bar</span><br>
The progress bar is a still image. It is moved from left to right
according to the action measured. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Waiting
bars</span><br>
The waiting bar images are displayed animated one after another,
looping, until the action measured is terminated. <br>
