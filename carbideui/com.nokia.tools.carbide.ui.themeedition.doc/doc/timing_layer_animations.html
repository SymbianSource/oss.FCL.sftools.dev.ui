<ul>

all those values that you want to animate. With the slider for each
value, adjust the intensity of the effect at each control point. <br>
<ul>
  <li>The animation timing is ready to be set for the chosen values.</li>

effect. </li>
</ul>
Repeat this procedure for every animated effect in your animation.<br>
