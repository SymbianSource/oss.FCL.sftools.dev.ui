<h2>Common image editing features</h2>
<br>
A theme can specify a variety of images and animations used for full
screen backgrounds, highlight images, standard menu icons, and other
miscellaneous images.The bounding areas, and the way the device scales
the images within those areas, vary for each theme element and from
handset to handset. Carbide.ui displays BMP, WBMP, JPG, GIF, M3G, and
(for screen savers and wallpapers) SVG and Flash, and (for wallpapers)
ZIP archives of image files. Specific devices can support different
sets of image content types.<br>
<h3>Image scaling</h3>
Images are scaled differently depending on the theme element. Four
types of scaling are supported in Nokia handsets:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stretch:</span> Images are
stretched up or down to exactly fill the bounding area. The original
aspect ratio can change.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Up/Down to Fit: </span>Images
are scaled up or down so that the entire image fits into the bounding
area. Any extra space is shown as white. The image is centered along
both axes and the original aspect ratio is preserved.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Down to Fit:</span> Images are
only scaled down until the entire image fits into the bounding area.
Images smaller than the bounding area are not scaled up. The image is
centered along both axes and the original aspect ratio is preserved.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Best:</span> Images are scaled
down until the first dimension fits the area, and any excess parts of
the image are cropped. Smaller images are not scaled up. The image is
centered along both axes and the original aspect ratio is preserved.</li>
</ul>
