<h2>Pinboard</h2>
The Pinboard application main area consists of a background graphic.
The mobile phone user can choose to view the items in a grid or list
format. The Pinboard application consists of the following parts:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Background</span><br>
The application background creates a frame where the Pinboard items can
be placed. The background graphics can be theme-specific. The
application background has the same structure as the Calendar or pop-up
window backgrounds. The background consists of nine bitmaps: <br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Four corner bitmaps </li>
  <li>Four side bitmaps </li>
  <li>Center bitmap </li>
</ul>
You can design the corner bitmaps independently. The side and center
area graphics can be tiled or equal the maximum size of the component
area. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Highlight</span><br>
The displayed highlight depends on the selected view format. If the
format is a grid, the highlight used is the one defined for all grids.
If the items are displayed in a list, the highlight used is the one
defined for lists. <br>
Title/search string entry<br>
The title of the focused item and search string entry are displayed in
the general input highlight graphics. <br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lower
screen area</span><br>
The lower screen area contains the general UI background graphics. If
the control pane has an area-specific background image defined, it is
displayed. The softkey color is the one defined for softkeys in
general. <br>
<br>
