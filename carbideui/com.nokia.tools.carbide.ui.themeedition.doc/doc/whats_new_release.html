<h2>Whats New in the Release</h2>
<br>
Carbide.ui has been designed with the creative professional in mind. It
allows the S60 and Series 40 UI to be customized with full WYSIWYG
layout, without the need for layout definition, coding, or specialized
mobile design experience. In addition, Carbide.ui can be integrated
with a wide range of creative graphic and audio packages, allowing
designers to work with their favorite tools.<br>
<br>
Carbide.ui 3.2 Theme Edition enables creation of S60 Audio themes.
Audio themes are supported on some of the S60 3rd Edition, Feature Pack
1 and later phones, such as the Nokia 5700 XpressMusic phone.<br>
<br>
Once a theme has been created, Carbide.ui can be used to package the
theme into an installation file and prepare it for Open Mobile Alliance
(OMA) digital rights management (DRM) protection, if required, after
which it will be ready for deployment to devices.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">-Support for the elements of SPR 7.2
in Series 40 </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">-Support Arabic and Hebrew icons</span><br>
<br>
<h2>Known Problems and Limitations:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">SVG created in Adobe Illustrator
CS3: </span>In rare cases, SVG created in Adobe Illustrator CS3 and
saved using the default mode (not using the Save for Web &amp; Devices
option) appears to be outside the viewbox when applied to theme
components. These graphics appear as if their top-left corner has been
translated toward the center of the theme component. This happens
either during the save in Illustrator, when Carbide.ui converts the SVG
to SVGT, or when such SVG files are pasted in to Carbide.ui, where
Carbide.ui filters out all non-SVGT-compliant content. This filtered
content is an Adobe-specific transformation of the inverse viewBox
matrix; for example, viewBox="-0.75 0.748 20 8").</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; Workaround:</span> Use
the Illustrator CS3 Save for Web &amp; Devices option when saving SVG
files.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Switching Series 40 Theme
versions: </span>Switching of the Series 40 Theme version is not
supported. (Switching platform versions is supported for S60 graphical
themes.) </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Workaround:</span> See
the Compatibility Issues section of this document for a description of
the workaround.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Animated layers and effects
(layer animations) &mdash; S60 themes only</span>: The behavior of an
animation in the Carbide.ui preview and on a device may differ. This is
because, on a device, some of the animation elements do not support all
of the available effects when they are applied to the first layer. </li>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Workaround: </span>Test
themes on a device to confirm it works as expected.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Relative time-mode animations</span>
&mdash; S60 themes only: Elements in backgrounds and areas support
relative time-mode animations with two control points (start and end)
only. In addition, SVG graphics are recommended for use in combination
with animated background effects. The Zebra theme provides an example
of recommended practice.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;Workaround: Use only start and end control points for
elements in backgrounds and areas.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Undo failures:</span> In rare
cases, Undo may fail after the platform has been changed several times
or after switching the simulated resolution.&nbsp; </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Workaround: Undo changes manually.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Opening workspaces:</span>
Problems may occur when opening a workspace edited with earlier
versions of Carbide.ui. This is a known Eclipse defect. </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Workaround: The metadata folder in any existing workspace
should be cleared. There is no need to delete existing projects from
the workspace. All folders inside Eclipse\Configuration folder should
be cleared, except config.ini file, which must not be edited or removed.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Workspace path: </span>The
workspace path should not contain non-ASCII characters.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Project names:</span> Carbide.ui
may not work properly for projects containing non-ASCII characters
running on non-Unicode platforms.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Linking project paths:</span>
Linking project path is case-sensitive. </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Embedded images in SVG images:</span>
Embedded bitmaps (PNG, JPG, and BMP) within SVG are not supported. </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Series 40 emulator support: </span>All
Series 40 features work on the Series 40 5th Edition, Feature Pack 1
emulator, for GIF and animated GIF format ONLY.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Device testing: During development, themes created in
Carbide.ui were fully tested against the Series 40 and S60 emulators.
Exhaustive testing against devices was not conducted; as a result,
differences may be noticed when themes are installed on some devices.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>&nbsp;It is known that formats such as SWF, SVG, and M3G do not
work consistently on devices.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Series 40 Big Clock:</span>
Image skinning of Series 40 Big Clock hands is not supported and a
preview for color skinning is not available.</li>
  <li>S60 elements: The elements under the following S60 theme
categories are available in the tool, but have no effect when displayed
on a device:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Secondary Vertical Line</li>
    <li>Secondary Horizontal Line</li>
    <li>Primary Vertical Line</li>
    <li>Primary Horizontal Line</li>
    <li>Phone Memory</li>
    <li>Push To Talk Settings</li>
    <li>Stream Link</li>
    <li>Application Open State Indication</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Both Marker icons</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Todo</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Icons -&gt; Toolbar Icons</li>
    <li>Icons -&gt; eSWT Icons</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Colors -&gt; eSWT and Colors -&gt; MIDP Colors</li>
    <li>Icons -&gt; Miscellaneous Icons -&gt; Idle Item Indicators</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Blue bubbles for Active Call Frame, First Active Call Bubble,
Second Call Bubble will still appear in the phone.</li>
  <li>POC call bubbles are not tested.</li>
  <li>In 2nd Edition FP2, for Highlights, Pop-up Windows, Indicators
and Applications under Resources view, some elements are having place
holders, but the icons will not appear.</li>
  <li>In 2nd Edition FP2, the 3rd party Application icons are not
getting packaged.</li>
  <li>Tool shows an error (Error loading content) while opening few S40
themes eventhough they seem to be valid themes (even if they work on
phone). This happens if the themes were not created using Carbide.ui.</li>
  <li>The thumbnail image &ldquo;large_thumbnail.gif&rdquo; cannot be
defined in the Carbide.ui. The tool is removing the thumbnail when a
theme (with thumbnail) is loaded, changed and packaged.</li>
  <li>In Windows Vista Business Edition, for 3rd Edition FP1 and FP2
themes, SVG to SVGt conversion is not working while saving the themes.</li>
  <li>In Windows Vista Business Edition, for 3rd Edition FP1 and
FP2,&nbsp; SVG to MIF conversion is not working while packaging. </li>
</ul>
