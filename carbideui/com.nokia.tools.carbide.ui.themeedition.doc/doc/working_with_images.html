<h2>Working with Images</h2>
<br>
When creating a theme images are the content type you will work with
most often. This section provides you with all the information you need
to work with images. Themes use two styles of images, static images and
animations. Static images can be either bitmaps or SVG images.
Animation fall into two broad categories, those you can create in
Carbide.ui and those that you need an external tool to create.
Information on working with images is presented in Working with
Animations.<br>
