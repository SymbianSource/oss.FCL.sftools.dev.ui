<h2>Clock</h2>
You can create clocks to match the overall theme design. The digital or
analog clock is displayed on the context pane of the idle view. The
mobile phone user can select the clock type displayed. The same clocks
are displayed in the Clock application.<br>
<h3>Analog clock</h3>
The analog clock consists of five parts:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Face1 </li>
  <li>Current date frame </li>
  <li>Face2 </li>
  <li>Hour pointer </li>
  <li>Minute pointer </li>
</ul>
The figure below illustrates a default analog clock and a
customized analog clock.<br>
<br>
A theme may alter the graphics used, however, the outlook and position
of the pointers and the date numbers are fixed. Use the Face1 image to
render the basic clock table and possible background effects. The image
may contain clock numbers, a shadow color, or a halo effect. Current
date frame is used as a background for the date indicator in the
right-center of the clock face. The Face2 image sets the highlight of
the clock; it is drawn on top of the rest of the images.<br>
<br>
Pointer graphics must always start from the exact center of the
bounding box to position the hands correctly. You can use all the
listed clock graphics. The analog clock date numbers are not shown.<br>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Digital
clock</h3>
The digital clock consists of masked number and separator character
images. Each individual number and separator consists of two images.
The first image contains the character and possible effect color or
texture. The second image contains a hard mask to create clear
characters. The images overlap in the clock area in accordance with a
fixed position. The digital clock is created in two steps:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Background effect creation </li>
  <li>Character creation </li>
</ul>
To create the background effect, use the first image. Mask the
character image with the second image in order to put different types
of effects, such as a shadow or halo to the background. When displayed
in a mobile phone, the images overlap one another. The number or
separator character images get masked from the second image, so the
characters are drawn on top and the effects are on the underlying
layer. In order to ensure that the characters do not overlap, they need
to be placed in a defined &lsquo;safe&rsquo; area.<br>
