<h2>Managing Views</h2>
You can manage the location and the size of the views in Carbide.ui.
This way you can customize the tool according to your preferences. In
Carbide.ui, all the possible views are not displayed automatically. In
addition, some of the views are collected in tab groups, and you can
access those views by clicking the name of the desired view in the tab.
Some views are only accessible through the Window menu or through the
Resources view. You can restore layout by selecting <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Window -&gt; Reset
perspective</span>.<br>
