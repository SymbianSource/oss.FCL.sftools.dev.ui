<h2>Taking contents from existing themes</h2>
As an alternative to copying and pasting, you can take components from
another theme and add them to your current theme. This mechanism works
in a similar way as copying components in a hierarchy. Having selected
the category or sub-category that needs to be copied over from another theme,
 open the context menu and select the
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Take Content From</span> option. This opens a sub-menu which gives a
list of themes from which components can be
taken. The list of themes can be configured to include themes from the workspace, 
example themes or a custom list of themes.<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img

 src="taking_elements_existing_themes.png"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure:</span> Taking &nbsp;content
from existing themes<br>
</div>
<br>
The list of available themes from which components can be taken is
configured with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Adjust List&hellip;</span>
option, which opens the <a href="preferences_component_store.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Component
Store</span></a> preferences.
