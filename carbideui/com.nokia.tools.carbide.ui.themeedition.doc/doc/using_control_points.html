<h2>Using Control Points</h2>
<br>
In the Animation editor view, you can add, edit, and delete control
points for animations. Control points define the points in the
animation timeline when something changes. You can define as many
control points as needed.<br>
<br>
There are two ways to use control points:<br>
<ul>
  <li>In layer animations, control points allow you to define the
intensity of an effect at a certain point in the timeline. When you
click a control point of an animated effect, a slider appears and
allows you to define the intensity of the effect at that control point.
  </li>
  <li>In frame animations, control points mark the point in the
timeline when a frame changes to another frame. There are as many
frames as there are control points. </li>
</ul>
You can:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Add control points by: </li>
  <li>Double-clicking the timeline </li>
  <li>Right-clicking the timeline and selecting Create Control Point </li>
  <li>Move control points to a different point at a timeline by
dragging them with the mouse. </li>
  <li>Delete control points by right-clicking them and selecting Remove
Control Point. </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> Control points can only
be added to animated effects, and not at all to layers. To use control
points, make sure you have checked the Animate box for the layer you
wish to animate.<br>
