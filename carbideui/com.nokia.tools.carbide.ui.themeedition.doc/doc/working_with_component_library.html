<h2>Working with the Component Library</h2>
Carbide.ui provides component libraries for icons, images and sounds.
These libraries are displayed separately in their own component views.
Each component view contains the icons, images and sounds that are
suitable to use for that component. You can:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Select components for editing </li>
  <li>Edit components </li>
  <li>Import new component </li>
</ul>
The component libraries are accessed through the Resources view.
Components can be edited either in Carbide.ui or in external editors.<br>
