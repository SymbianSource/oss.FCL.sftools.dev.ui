<h2>Managing themes</h2>
Carbide.ui handles themes as projects. You can import your own theme
and theme components into Carbide.ui. <br>
<br>
When working with themes, you have the following options: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Managing themes </li>
  <ul>
    <li>This includes creating new
and opening existing themes. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Importing and exporting
themes </li>
  <li>Managing theme component
libraries </li>
  <ul>
    <li>This includes adding and
deleting of, for example, icons to and
from icon libraries, one component at a time. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Editing theme components </li>
  <ul>
    <li>This includes editing
components in Carbide.ui and in external
editors. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Creating tasks for themes </li>
  <ul>
    <li>This includes, for
example, creating tasks for certain repeated
image component. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Deleting themes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
Finalized themes can be compiled into sis-packages. These files can
then be sent to a mobile phone or added to your personal theme library.
Carbide.ui supports Digital Rights Management (DRM), allowing you to
securely protect your themes. <br>
<br>
Themes are located in your workspace. You are asked to define a
workspace when you open Carbide.ui, but you can always change your
workspace from the File menu. Also, different users can have their own
workspaces. You can also link existing themes into your workspace. <br>
