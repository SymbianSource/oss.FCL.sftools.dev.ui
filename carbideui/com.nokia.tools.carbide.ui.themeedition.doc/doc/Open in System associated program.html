<h2>Open in System associated
program</h2>
<br>
To edit an image in the application your system has associated with the
image&rsquo;s file type, select the component you want to edit and
from
the context menu select Open in System associated program.<br>
<br>
If your system has an associated editor for the image type, the image
will be opened in that editor in a separate window. <br>
<br>
Once you have completed the edits to the image, save it using the
editor&rsquo;s standard save option. You can now return to
Carbide.ui.
The UI editor is automatically refreshed to reflect the changes you
made to the component. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:
</span>If there is no
associated application available then by default it opens in Internet
explorer.<br>
