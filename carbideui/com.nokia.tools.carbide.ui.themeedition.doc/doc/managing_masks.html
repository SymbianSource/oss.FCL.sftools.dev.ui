<h2>Managing masks</h2>
Masks are used in some images to prevent unwanted pixels from being
displayed in the user interface (UI).<br>
<br>
Items can have two different types of masks:<br>
<ul>
  <li>1-bit masks (hard masks) </li>
  <li>8-bit masks (soft masks) </li>
</ul>
An 8-bit mask is a greyscale image and allows creation of soft edges
(anti-aliasing), and semi-transparency. The mask type is
component-specific. Generally, 8-bit masks are applicable, unless
otherwise indicated.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>
Software vector graphics
(svg) icons are parsed with their own opacity. Separate masks are not
needed.<br>
