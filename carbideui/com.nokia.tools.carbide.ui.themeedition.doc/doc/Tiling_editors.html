<h1>Tiling Editors</h1>
<p>Carbide.ui allows you to
have multiple themes open in multiple editors. However, you can tile
editor sessions within the editor area, in order to view multiple
themes side by side. </p>
<ol>
  <li>With two or more themes open
in the editor area, select one of the editor tabs. </li>
  <li>Holding down the left mouse
button, drag that editor over the left, right, top or bottom border of
the editor area. Notice that the mouse pointer changes to a <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"drop cursor"</span>
that indicates where the editor session will be moved when you release
the mouse button. </li>
  <li>(Optional) Drag the borders
of the editor area or each editor, to resize as desired. </li>
</ol>
<p>This is a similar operation to
moving and docking views inside the tool , except that all editor
sessions must be contained within the editor area.</p>
