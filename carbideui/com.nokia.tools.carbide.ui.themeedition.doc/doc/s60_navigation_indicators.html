<h2>Navigation Indicators</h2>
<br>
Arrowheads are used in the default user interface (UI) look and feel to
indicate possible navigation directions. The items are used in Navi
Pane, list and grid scrolling, and as a submenu indicator.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Navi
Pane scrolling indicators</span><br>
The left and right scrolling indicators are displayed at both ends of
the Navi Pane. Indicators are either visible or invisible. If they are
displayed, scrolling in the indicated direction is possible. You can
change the left and right scrolling indicators with black and white
images, where black pixels are displayed in the theme and white is used
as a mask. The color displayed is the value defined for Navi Pane texts
and icons.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Submenu
indicator</span><br>
An arrowhead in the default UI appearance at the right side of the menu
list item indicates a submenu. You can replace the indicator graphic.<br>
