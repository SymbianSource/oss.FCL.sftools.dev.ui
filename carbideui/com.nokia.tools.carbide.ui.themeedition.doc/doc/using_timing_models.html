<h2>Using Timing Models</h2>
A timing model allows you to set when an animation is played. You can
choose from two timing models:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Relative</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Relative time changes are slow. It is recommended to use them
in background components. The animation starts when a theme is
activated in a mobile phone. Options for the relative time model are: </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Monthly </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Weekly </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Daily </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Hourly </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span>By setting the time
slice to 5 and selecting Daily, the animation is shown 5 times during
one day.<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Real time</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Real time is used for fast animations. It is recommended to use
it for list, grid and focus highlight. Real time units are in seconds. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
