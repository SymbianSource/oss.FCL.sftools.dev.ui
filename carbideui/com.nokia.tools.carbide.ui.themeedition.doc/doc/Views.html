<h2>Views</h2>
Carbide.ui provides different views that all play a part in theme creation. The
structure of the views is designed to help the theme creation process,
by showing all relevant information on the screen at the same time. For
example, the file structure of your workspace can be seen from the
Navigator view, while the current theme is active in the Theme editor
view. You can customize all the views according to your own
preferences. You can maximize or minimize a certain view if you like to
work on one view at a time.<br>
<br>
The views in Carbide.ui are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Navigator view.</li>
  <li>Resources view.</li>
  <li>Gallery view.</li>
  <li>Component view.</li>
  <li>Component store view.</li>
  <li>Properties view.</li>
  <li>Layers view.</li>
  <li>Referenced colors view.</li>
  <li>Outline view.</li>
  <li>Tasks view.</li>
  <li>Search view.</li>
  <li>Bookmarks view.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> Each view has a context
menu that provides rapid access to the additional functions provided by
that view. Some views also provide a toolbar that provides rapid access to
the most common functions of that view.<br>
