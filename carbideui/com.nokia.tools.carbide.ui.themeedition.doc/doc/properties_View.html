<h2>Properties View</h2>
<br>
The Properties view displays all the properties of the component that
is highlighted in the Editor. These properties include two tabbed
sections:<br>
<ul>
  <li>General &mdash;This
includes the platform information, stretch
mode, an ID, and bounds (coordinates) for the component. </li>
  <li>Bitmap &mdash; This
includes the Colorize and Optimize options,
which allow you to transform vector graphic components (.svg's) into
bitmaps. </li>
</ul>
You display a component's properties by selecting a component, for
example, by highlighting the component in the Editor. The available
properties can then be adjusted in the Properties view.<br>
<br>
<h3>General tab</h3>
The General tab provides the following:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Platforms &mdash;
&nbsp; A series of icons
indicate the platforms in
which the selected component is available for display on a device. </li>
  <li>ID &mdash;
&nbsp;Displays the&nbsp; ID of the selected element
 and cannot be edited by the user.</li>
  <li>Bounds &mdash;
&nbsp;Displays the co-ordinates for the selected
element. </li>
  <li>Stretch mode &mdash;
&nbsp;This option allows you to choose the whether the image should be stretched or kept as-is.  
Keep Aspect Ratio mode retains the image as it is where as stretch mode option stretches the image to fit the device screen (Note : This option is not available for all elements).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bitmap tab</h3>
The Bitmap tab allows properties to be defined that colorize and optimize a
component&rsquo;s bitmap graphics . <br>
In the Colorize group, the Colorize check box is used to turn the
colorize feature on and off. When on, a color with which to colorize
the graphic can be selected. <br>
In the Optimize group, the Optimize check box is used to turn the
optimization feature on and off. When on, there are two optimization
options:<br>
Dither &mdash; this feature creates the illusion of color depth in
images using a limited color palette and reduces the size of bitmap
graphics compared to using a full color palette.<br>
<br>
Quality &mdash; three quality options are provided:<br>
<ul>
  <li>High</li>
  <li>Low</li>
  <li>Palette dependent</li>
</ul>
