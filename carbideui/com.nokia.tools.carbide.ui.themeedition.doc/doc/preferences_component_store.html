<h2>Component store</h2>
<br>
The Component store allows you to access the graphics and to collect
graphics from theme elements for re-use in any themes. For more
information on using the component store see Working with the component
library.<br>
<br>
This preference dialog allows you to determine which components are
displayed in the Component Store view. The available options are:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Show components of themes
in the
current workspace</span> shows the
components from the themes in the
current workspace &ndash; see Choosing / switching a workspace for
more
information on workspaces.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Show components of listed
themes</span>
show the components from a list of themes you select yourself. These
themes can include, themes from any other workspace, or themes
stored in any other accessible folder. To add a theme select <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Add&hellip;</span>
and browse for the theme
you wish to add. You can remove any theme from the list by selecting it
and selecting <span style="font-weight: bold;">Remove.</span></li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align: left;"><br>
To restore the settings to those Carbide.ui had when it was first
installed select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Restore Defaults</span>.
Selecting <span style="font-weight: bold;">Apply</span>
applies the
settings without exiting the preferences dialog. If <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Apply</span>
is not used then the settings
become active when <span style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span>
is
selected in the main Preferences dialog.<br>
<br>
