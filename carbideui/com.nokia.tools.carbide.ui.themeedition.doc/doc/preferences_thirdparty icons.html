<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>Third Party Icons</h2>
<br>
Third-party icons are icons that can be created for third-party 
applications or the files and folders associated with a third-party 
application or service. The graphics content of these icons can be
modified in the same way that the icons supplied with Carbide.ui
are. However, you need either the application&rsquo;s unique identifier
(UID) or the file or folder identifiers (IDs) in order to associate a
third-party icon created in Carbide.ui with the correct item. In most
cases, it is necessary to contact the developer of the application or
service to obtain the necessary UIDs and IDs.<br>
<br>

<p class="MsoBodyText">The new feature of third-party icons allows for
giving
them the following scope:<o:p></o:p></p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"></span></span></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;" class="ListItemHead"><span style="">Tool-specific icons</span></span> &mdash; These icons are
available for use in all themes created with Carbide.ui.<o:p></o:p></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span
 style=""></span></span><span class="ListItemHead"><span style=""><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Theme-specific icons</span> </span></span>&mdash;
These icons are
available for use in a specific theme only.<o:p></o:p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
To access the third-party-icon feature of Carbide.ui, select Windows
&gt; Preferences then the Third Party Icons option in the Carbide.ui
tree. The dialog shown in Figure below is then displayed<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img
 alt=""
 src="preferences_thirdparty_icons.png"><br>
Figure: </span>Third Party Icons<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></div>
<br>
From the Third Party Icons window, the following options are available:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">New</span> &mdash; Creates a new
third-party icon.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Delete</span> &mdash; Deletes an
existing third-party icon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating a new third-party icon</h2>
A new third-party icon is created by clicking the New button in the
Third Party Icon dialog. The New Third Party Icon window is then
opened, as shown in Figure below. <br>
<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img
 alt=""
 src="preferences_thirdparty_icons1.png"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure:</span> New Third Party Icon<br>
<br>
<br>
</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Select either the Application
or Non Application radio button to indicate the type of third-party
icon to be created. Select the Non Application radio button for files
and folders. Next, enter the following information:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Name </span>&mdash; A name for
the icon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>For application icons:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Application UID</span> &mdash;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This value must match the third-party
application&rsquo;s UID. The value will be in the range of 0xA0000000
to 0xAFFFFFFF for applications that are not Symbian Signed and in the
range of 0x20000000 to 0x2FFFFFFF for Symbian Signed applications.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>For non-application icons (icons for files and folders):</li>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Major ID&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&mdash; A value between 0x00000000 and 0xffffffff.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Minor ID</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&mdash; A value between 0x000 and 0xfff.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
The combination of major and minor IDs is unique for each specific
folder or file icon. Once the required information has been entered,
clicking <span style="font-weight: bold;">OK </span>adds the icon to
the third-party icon list, as shown in Figure below.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note :</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Major ID </span>and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Minor ID</span> information will be
required only for non-application Icons. <br>

Third-party icons are then available in the Components view, along with
the other available icons, as shown in Figure below.<br>

<h3>Further information on third-party icons</h3>
<br>
For the creation of a third-party icon, the application UID or
combination of major ID and minor ID must be unique. That is, any
third-party icon can be available either in a specific theme or to all
themes, but not both. Should conflicts arise, Carbide.ui indicates them
by highlighting the icon items in red in the icon lists, as shown in
Figure below.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img
 alt=""
 src="preferences_thirdparty_icons5.png"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure:</span> Conflicting Third Party
Icons<br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br>
<br>
Because there could be several conflicting icons, Carbide.ui helps
identify specific conflicts. It does this by highlighting in yellow the
corresponding item when a conflicting item is selected, as shown in
Figure below.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img
 alt=""
 src="preferences_thirdparty_icons3.png"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure:</span> Highlighting
Conflicting Icons</div>
<br>

All the conflicting icons can be deleted from the respective groupings at one-shot by clicking on the "Delete Conflicts" button. Also "Delete All" button deletes all the Icons.
