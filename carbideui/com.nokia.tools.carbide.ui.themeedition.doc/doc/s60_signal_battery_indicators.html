<h2>Signal/Battery Indicators</h2>
<br>
The mobile phone UI contains two important strength level indicators:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Signal strength indicator </li>
  <li>Battery level indicator </li>
</ul>
Both indicators have the same structure. The signal strength and
battery level icons are displayed beneath the strength levels. Strength
levels are displayed by revealing the strength bitmap in sections. You
can change the color of the icons and the level bitmaps, but the
sections are predefined.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:
</span>Levels are animated when
a device is charging. Animation consists of revealing the step levels
from 0 to 7 repeatedly, until the battery is full. The signal network
icon is displayed with a packet data indicator when the network is
available and the mobile phone user has subscribed to it. The same icon
color is used.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:
</span>Placement of the signal
and battery indicator may vary in landscape mode. <br>
<br>
<h3>Signal Strength Indicator</h3>
The signal strength indicator is displayed on the top left corner of
the screen. Optimum reception is indicated by having all seven levels
revealed. No reception is indicated when no levels are displayed. It is
important that levels are clearly indicated, as reception clarity and
network availability may affect the mobile phone user's actions. Full
screen applications, such as Pinboard, Speed dial and games, do not
display signal strength indicators in portrait view.<br>
<br>

<br>
<h3>Battery level indicator</h3>
The battery level indicator is displayed only when the device is in
idle mode or during power saving mode when the mobile phone is being
charged. Like the signal strength indicator, the battery level
indicator consists of seven levels. The indicator measures the
available battery energy levels.<br>
