<h2>Areas</h2>
The phone's screen is divided into three areas. Carbide.ui allows
you to edit these areas:<br>
<h3>Status Area</h3>
The Status area, which is the upper part of the mobile phone's screen,
consists of three sub-areas: Status Area Background, Navi Pane
Background, and Idle Status Area Background. <br>
<h3>Main Area</h3>
The Main area, which is the large middle part of the mobile phone's
screen, consists of five different sub-areas. These sub-areas include,
for example, active and idle main area backgrounds. <br>
<h3>Control Area</h3>
The Control area, which is the bottom part of the mobile phone's
screen, consists of two sub-areas, the Control Area Background and the
Idle Control Area Background. <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>
Most of the areas contain
a background layer by default, allowing you to define transparency for
the components. The Navi Pane component does not contain a background
layer as a default. To add a background layer to Navi Pane, select the
component and go to Layers view or the Animation Editor. Right-click
the layer and select Add Background. Now you can add effects to the
background layer.<br>
