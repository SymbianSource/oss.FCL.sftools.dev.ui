<h2>Setting up signing</h2>
<br>
When creating a sis-package of a theme, you can sign the package with a
private key and a certificate. This verifies the identity of the sender
and ensures that the file has not been tampered with since it was
signed.<br>
<br>
The signing functionality consists of : <br>
<ul>
  <li>Creating a private key and
certificate </li>
  <li>Defining key pairs that are
used to sign a sis-package</li>
  <li>You can define several key
pairs. </li>
  <li>Editing existing key pairs </li>
  <li>Deleting the key pairs you
no longer need </li>
</ul>
