<h2>Animation Editor</h2>
With the Animation editor, you can create simple animations for
different components of your themes. You can access the Animation
editor by right-clicking a highlighted component in the Theme
editor and selecting Edit/Animate selected elements. Only certain
theme components, such as backgrounds and specific icons, can be
animated.<br>
<br>
The Animation editor has two main sections. These sections are:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Preview section </span>&mdash;
You can preview your animation in this section. You can also edit the
image components of a single frame. </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Timeline settings and playback</span>
&mdash; This section allows you to control the previewing of your
animation. It also allows you to set the timeline and control points
for your animations. </li>
</ul>
You can set effects for layers either in Animation editor, or in
Properties view<br>
