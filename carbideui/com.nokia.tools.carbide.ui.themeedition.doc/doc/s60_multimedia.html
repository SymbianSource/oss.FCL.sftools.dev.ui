<h2>Multimedia </h2>
<br>
The Symbian phone supports sounds in themes. In Carbide.ui, the
following multimedia elements can be edited:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Ringing Tone Sound </li>
  <li>Message Alert Sound </li>
  <li>Screen Saver</li>
</ul>
You can add, edit, and delete ring tones and message alerts, and clear
sound files back to their default state. You can only delete sounds you
have created yourself. The sounds can be edited in the external sound
editor which is configured to be used with Carbide.ui. Carbide.ui
supports *.wav, *.mp3, *.mp4, *.mid, *.wma, *.3gp, *.rmf, *.awb, *.rng,
*.au, *.rm, *.amr, *.ra, *.ott files for sounds.<br>
<br>
In Multimedia, you can also add a screen saver for the sis-package.
Carbide.ui supports animated screen savers. The screen saver can be a
*.sis, *.swf, *.gif, *.svgz or a *.svg file.<br>
